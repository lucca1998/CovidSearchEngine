# CovidSearchEngine
<p>This engine is a beginner code in Python I used in my first semester in school.

data.csv is a file given by the European CDC to track cases and deaths in 2020 around the world.
you can find the same file in <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide
">ECDC</a>


covid_search_read.py reads the csv file and store the data in a list

covid_search_engine.py is the main file, it will import the list from the previous python file and create a window in tkinter where you can type the information you want (like country name or date) and it will be displayed in the new window.
