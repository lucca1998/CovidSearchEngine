<h2>CovidSearchEngine</h2>
<p>This engine is a beginner code in Python that I used in my first semester in school.

<b>data.csv<b> is a file given by the European CDC to track cases and deaths in 2020 around the world.
you can find the same file in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide
">ECDC</a>


<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lucca1998/CovidSearchEngine/blob/main/covid_search_read.py">covid_search_read.py</a> reads the csv file and store the data in a list

<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lucca1998/CovidSearchEngine/blob/main/covid_search_engine.py">covid_search_engine.py</a> is the main file, it will import the list from the previous python file and create a window in tkinter where you can type the information you want (like country name or date) and it will be displayed in the new window.
</p>

<h3>You will need to intall these programs and libraries to run the program</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Tkinter lib</li>
</ul>
